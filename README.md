# ua-mobile-challenge
The project that gave me access to the final of UA Mobile Challenge. Judges are forbidden to anounce it to public before they don't announce the results, so it is pushed in 1 commit.

I designed a game in which the protagonist should dodge other objects, chaotically moving around the screen, and do not crash into edge of the screen. Movement speed of enemy objects increase with time.
##### In this application I have used: 
+ Android SDK
+ accelerometer

I hope you enjoy =)

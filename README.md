# ua-mobile-challenge
The project that gave me access to the final of UA Mobile Challenge. Judges are forbidden to anounce it to public before they don't announce the results, so it is pushed in 1 commit.

The essence of the game to hold out as long as possible without bumping into walls and enemies.

I hope you enjoy =)
